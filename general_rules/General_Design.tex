In this chapter the general rules will be explained that are valid for all tests. This chapter is seperated into the sections robot, arena environment, Service Areas and Objects.

%Each of the particular tests defined later in this document may define its own scenario. In this document, a scenario consists of elements such as the
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item environment,
%	\item Objects that affect navigation,
%	\item Objects that are to be manipulated,
%	\item Objects with which robots interact,
%	\item number of robots allowed per team,
%	\item number of teams competing simultaneously in the same arena,
%	\item task to be performed by a team, and
%	\item the criteria for evaluating a team's performance.
%\end{itemize}
%
%In order to avoid excessive development efforts for each specific test and to allow reuse of partial functionalities the scenarios are built from a reasonably small set of components, which are later put together in different ways. This section describes these elements.

\section{Robots}
The robots used for competition shall satisfy professional quality standards. The concrete definition of these standards is to be assessed by the TC, comprising aspects such as sturdy construction, general safety, and robust operation. It is not required that the robots are certified for industrial use.

\subsection{Design and Constraints} \label{ssec:RobotDesignAndConstraints}
%The robots need to comply with certain size constraints. A robot, including all parts attached to it as used in the competition, must be able to move by itself into a configuration so that it fits into a box of side lengths 80 cm x 55 cm x 110 cm (length x width x height). If all the robot's parts, such as manipulator or anything able to protrude outside of the previously specified box, are fully extended, the system must still not exceed a box of side lengths 120 cm x 80 cm x 160 cm (length x width x height). The organizers may specify further constraints, such as weight limits. If a team would like to apply a robot with deviating robot dimensions, it should contact the TC. Exceptions for specific robots are possible in case of small differences.

There are no constraints regarding the size and weight of the used robots, but that they have to fit in the arena defined in section \ref{sec:ArenaDesign}. The minimum passage width is $80\si{\centi\meter}$. The used robots must be able to maneuver in that space.\par

The used batteries may not exceed 500Wh of capacity for safety. 300Wh of capacity is recommended. See subsection \ref{ssec:RobotBehaviorAndSafety} as well.\par 

The maximum speed of the robots may not exceed 1.5 m/s. The robot should also be able to halt in a reasonable space on concrete floor.\par 
\par
All robots must have an emergency stop button. The emergency stop has to be a hard stop mechanism, that ensures that the energy transfer to all actuators is stopped immediately and the robot halts. The mechanism must be a red emergency stop button that is clearly visible, easily accessible and per wire attached to the robot. A wireless emergency stop button is optional but not sufficient.
The OC may request the proof of a robot's safety (e.g. the correct operation of an emergency stop) anytime during the competition and exclude teams that cannot satisfy safety requirements.
\par
Electric, pneumatic, and hydraulic actuation mechanisms are permitted, provided that they are constructed and produced according to professional standards and meet safety constraints. Combustion engines and any kind of explosives are strictly forbidden. Robots may not pollute or harm their environment in any way, e.g. by loss of chemicals or oil, spilling liquids, or exhausting gases. Furthermore, constraints on the noise generated by a robot in operation may apply. These will be communicated in due time.
\par
Further, the following assumptions are made about the kind of robots used in the competition:
\par
\begin{itemize}

	\item At least one of the robots used by a team is mobile and moves on wheels. No specific assumptions are made about the kinematic design, but the mobile robots should be able to move on basically flat, sufficiently firm surfaces.
	\item The robots have at least one manipulator and are able to grasp Objects, which are graspable by a parallel gripper with a jaw width of at least $5\si{\centi\meter}$ and do not weigh more than 300 g.
	\item The manipulator of the robot should be designed and mounted on the robot such that it can grasp Objects from heights between $0\si{\centi\meter}$ and $40\si{\centi\meter}$ above the floor.
	\item The robots use sensors to obtain information about their whereabouts in the environment and the task-relevant Objects. The major types of sensors that may be used by the robots include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Laser range finders (cf. models by Hokuyo or Sick)
		\item Color CCD cameras (cf. any kind of USB camera)
		\item 3D cameras (cf. any kind of camera with depth information)
	\end{itemize}
	\item The design of the scenario should be such that the robots can solve the tasks safely and robustly using (all or a subset of) these sensors.

\end{itemize}

\par
If there are even vague doubts about the eligibility of using particular designs, parts, or mechanisms, the team should consult the TC well in advance.
\par
The robots have to be marked such that a clear distinction of robots used by different teams during a test is possible for spectators. The OC can define the concrete types of markers to be used. In this case the markers are not taken into account when checking the robot's size constraints. The markers shall not interfere with safe operation of the robot.
\par
The TC may require that robots are equipped with a wireless communication device of some sort (e.g. 802.11n), in order to communicate task specifications to the robots.
\par
Future competitions may foresee the use of RFID sensors in the scenario design.


\subsection{Behavior and Safety} \label{ssec:RobotBehaviorAndSafety}
For safety the robots have to meet the constraints in section \ref{ssec:RobotDesignAndConstraints}. In general, all robots shall be operated with maximum safety in mind. Any robot operation must be such that a robot neither harms humans nor damages the environment. \par 
The used batteries shall be handled with care and all team members must be educated in the correct usage, charging and storage of the batteries of the team. For lithium batteries appropriate storage bags must be used by the teams. The OC supplies a fire extinguisher for lithium batteries at the competition. If this is not sufficient for the used batteries of a team. The team is responsible for supplying an appropriate fire extinguisher by themselfs. The OC and TC control the observance of this rules.

When participating in a competition, the team may operate the robot only in their own team area, in the arenas provided (possibly constrained by a schedule assigning periods of time for exclusive use of the arena by a team or a group of teams), and in any other areas designated by the organizers for robot operation. Any operation of robots outside of these areas, e.g. in public areas or emergency paths, require prior permission by the OC.

\section{Arena Environment}
\label{sec:ArenaDesign}

\subsection{General}
\label{ssec:ArenaGeneral}

%\textbf{Layout:}

The competition is held in an arena resembling an example layout of industrial manufacturing facilities. 
The arena is a static 2D environment consisting of Walls, Tables and Obstacles etc. with a size of atleast 10 m$^2$ and not more than 120 m$^2$. 
An example layout is shown in fig. \ref{fig:arena_example}.

\begin{figure} [h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= 0.8\textwidth ]{./images/general_rules/arena_example.jpg}
\caption{An exemplary setup of a \RCAW environment.}
\label{fig:arena_example}
\end{figure}

Layouts may include rooms and hallways to create more realistic scenarios.
Service Areas (see section \ref{sec:Service_Areas}) mark the locations for robots to perform tasks.
Each requested Service Area must be accessible via atleast one path of $80\si{\centi\meter}$ width.

\begin{figure} [h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= 0.8\textwidth ]{./images/general_rules/arena_map_annotated}
\caption{Annotated 2D map of the environment in fig. \ref{fig:arena_example}}
\label{fig:arena_map_annotated}
\end{figure}

Each competition has a new and unique layout designed by the actual TC members.
It should feature:
\begin{itemize}
\item Area 10 m$^2$ - 120 m$^2$
\item Minimum distance between arena elements atleast $80\si{\centi\meter}$ 
\item Widespread Service Areas entailing robot movements
\item Multiple paths between Service Areas
\item START and FINISH area
\end{itemize}


\textbf{START and FINISH area:}
\label{subsubsec: Start and Goal Area}

One or two parts of the arena are separated with marking Tape and considered as START and FINISH area. The START and FINISH area can be the same or two independent areas. The robot may leave the START area and enter the FINISH area only once. An area is leaved or entered when more than $50\%$ of the robot crossed the marking Tape. In figure \ref{fig:tapeconfig} an exemplary Tape configuration is shown.

\begin{figure} [h!]

		\missingfigure[figwidth=6cm]{}	
	\end{center}
	\caption{Tape configuraion, TODO...}
	\label{fig:tapeconfig}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Floor}

The floor is made of some firm material. Examples include floors made of concrete, screed, timber, plywood, chipboard, laminated boards, linoleum, PVC flooring, or carpet. Some examples are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:example_floors}. Floors may neither be made of loose material of any kind (gravel, sand, or any material which may damage the functioning of the robot's wheels) nor may such material be used on top of the floor. Liquids of any kind are not allowed. The floor may have spots of unevenness of up to $1\si{\centi\meter}$ in any direction (clefts, rifts, ridges, etc.).

	\end{center}
	\caption{Examples of floors that can be used for \RCAW arenas.}
	\label{fig:example_floors}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Walls and Virtual Walls}
\label{subsec: Walls and virtual Walls}

The arena consists of outer and inner Walls used to build structures, create obstacles or function as protection barriers for teams and viewers. Walls may be either physical (plank) or virtual (red/white Tape). Walls have an infinitely height.
The arena is completely enclosed by Walls (both types possible), meaning robots are not allowed to exit the arena during a run. All types of Walls won't be changed during the competition. If the robot touches a Wall or Virtual Wall it results in a Major Collision.

The height of a physical Wall must be not less than $20\si{\centi\meter}$ and no more than $40\si{\centi\meter}$.
Most Walls have a uniform main color (white), but may be enforced by metal (aluminum framework) and decorated with sponsor logos or ads.

Virtual Walls are made of red/white Tape and may never be crossed during a run. The arena can contain Walls and Virtual Walls inside.

\begin{figure} [h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= 0.8\textwidth ]{./images/general_rules/barrier_tapes_in_china15.jpg}
\caption{Example of a typical arena. The red/white Tape indicates a Virtual Wall. The yellow/black Tape indicates a Virtual Obstacle and the white ashlar-formed cartonages are Obstacles.}
\label{fig:walls_and_virt_walls}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Obstacles}
\label{subsec: Obstacles}

In addition to the static arena elements, semi-dynamic Obstacles may be placed inside the arena before a competition run begins. 
The position of such Obstacles is decided by the referees during the setup phase of the run and randomized between different run types. Obstacles can be either physical or virtual.

Obstacles may block paths partly or completely, as long as all active Service Areas are still reachable.
There are three main Obstacle placement types:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Blocking:} 
A narrow section is completely blocked by the Obstacle, which means that no robot can physically pass it ($<$ $20\si{\centi\meter}$).

\item \textbf{Semi-Blocking:} 
The Obstacle reduces the distance between arena elements below the minimum width for a path ($<$ $80\si{\centi\meter}$). The path therefore counts as blocked, meaning that there must exist another valid path to all active Service Areas. Robots are still allowed to use all paths if they fit through the smaller gaps.

\item \textbf{Non-Blocking:}
The Obstacle adds or enlarges an arena element but keeps all paths intact.
\end{itemize}


Physical Obstacles measure atleast $2\si{\centi\meter}$ x $2\si{\centi\meter}$ x $20\si{\centi\meter}$ (l x w x h) and may be made of any non-transparent, firm material (wood, metal). Some examples are bins, shipping boxes and Wall elements. Their color is not specified.
All physical Obstacles are treated like any other arena element during a run, including the rules for collisions.

Virtual Obstacles are marked using the yellow/black Tape from section \ref{subsec:Tapes}. The collisions with these Virtual Obstacles will treated different (see REF SCORING).


\subsection{Tapes}
\label{subsec:Tapes}

\textbf{Red/white Tape:}

The red/white Tape (Tesa signal $5\si{\centi\meter}$ width) is considered as a Virtual Wall and has an infinite height. The red/white Tape is static and won't be changed during the whole competition. It will be used inside the arena and as an outer border of the arena.  Touching the red/white Tape is considered as a Major Collision.

\textbf{Yellow/black Tape:}

The yellow/black Tape (Tesa signal $5\si{\centi\meter}$ width) is considered as a Virtual Obstacles and has an infinite height. The yellow/black Tape will be placed by the Referees before a run that contains Virtual Obstacles. Touching the yellow/black Tape is considered as a Tape Collision.

\begin{figure} [h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width= 0.4\textwidth ]{./images/general_rules/example_barrier_tape}
	\caption{Example red/white and yellow/black Tapes}
	\label{fig:tapes}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Markup Tape:}

Green electrical tape is considered as markup Tape. This tape can be used everywhere, where it is useful. It is intended as a marker for the referees and teams and not for the robot. Therefore the color may deviate, but the color is not red or yellow to guarantee a clear difference to the other tapes. The tape is used to mark the START and FINISH area. Furthermore the tape can be used to mark the position of workstations (especially $0\si{\centi\meter}$) and Walls. The latter ones are useful for restoring the arena in case of a Major Collision.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec: Tables}

\leander{discuss $\pm 10\si{\centi\meter}$ for height and width\\ TODO: add picture}

A Table is considered as a Service Area.

%52. However, from 2020 on and in order to make the competition more realistic, the heights of the Tables will be variable, allowing the OC to adjust them before each test run.-> No???
%-> every height of the Tables can have a margin of $2\si{\centi\meter}$

%54. Define Table Size:
%-> 80cm x 50cm x X cm (0, 5, 10, 15)
%-> same size for shelf
%Leander

%However, from 2020 on and in order to make the competition more realistic, the heights of the service Areas will be variable, allowing the OC to adjust them before each test run. TODO...

The typical table has a width (the side the robot approaches) of $80\si{\centi\meter}$ and a depth of $50\si{\centi\meter}$. The used table heights are $0\si{\centi\meter}$, $5\si{\centi\meter}$, $10\si{\centi\meter}$ and $15\si{\centi\meter}$. See further down in this section for more information about the $0\si{\centi\meter}$-workstation. See figure \ref{fig:ws} for illustration.
 The tolerance for both the width and depth are $\pm 10\si{\centi\meter}$. 
The tolerance for the heigth is $\pm 1 \si{\centi\meter}$. During a competition the table size is only fixed in the margin of $\pm 1 \si{\centi\meter}$, because of arbitrary surfaces (see \ref{subsec:Arbitrary_Surfaces_and_Decoys} for an explanation of arbitrary surfaces). 
The table is closed between the bottom and the table top. That's why the tables can be used as a reference for navigation when the height is sufficient for the robot. Note that the height may change slightly with arbitrary surfaces during a competition and thus the table can sometimes be visible to the laser scanners and sometimes not. 
 
\begin{figure} [h!]
	\begin{center}
		%\includegraphics[height = 2.5cm]{./images/barrier_tape_0cm_area.jpg}
		\missingfigure[figwidth=6cm]{}	
	\end{center}
	\caption{different workstations}
	\label{fig:ws}
\end{figure}

If a Table has a height of zero cm, a green electrical Tape (see \ref{subsec:Tapes}) will mark the area. A $0\si{\centi\meter}$-Table can be active or inactive. Active means, that the current test (see \ref{sec:tests}) includes $0\si{\centi\meter}$-Tables.
If the Table is active, the surrounded area may be covered by a white sheet of paper, thin wood or arbitrary surface. The material is not fixed.
The OC is responsible to replace it in case of pollution or tears. To reduce the tear, it is removed when the $0\si{\centi\meter}$-Table are not active. If the floor is white or the workstation shall have an Arbitrary Surface, no cover needs to be installed.
$0\si{\centi\meter}$-Table may be crossed, and does not count as a collision. If the laid out white Surface is moved, it is not a collision.
If the robot touches an Object while navigating, this will be handled as a collision. Examples for $0\si{\centi\meter}$-workstations are shown in figure \ref{fig:0cmws}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Shelves}\label{sec:Shelves}
\leander{additional discussion necessary: is the lower part of the shelf a $10\si{\centi\meter}$ workstation or is any other height also allowed? \\
clarification necessary}


A Shelf is considered as a Service Area. The integration of Shelves into tests is according the table \ref{tab:Instances}. Service Areas may foresee the use of shelves and shelf units as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:shelf}. The lower part of the shelf is a $10\si{\centi\meter}$-workstation as specified in \ref{subsec: Tables}.
The maximum height of the shelves should be not more than $40\si{\centi\meter}$. In the example shown in Figure~\ref{fig:shelf} the first $15 \si{\centi\meter}\pm 2\si{\centi\meter} $ are not covered by the top shelf. The length of free space can be changed during competition and can not be seen as mandatory. Therefore all teams has to consider special picking behaviour to avoid collision.  

The top shelf surface may be specially designed in order to serve specific purposes, e.g.\, holding Objects. Objects to pic up are always placed on the bottom shelf, during the competition a placement of a delivered Object has to be done on the top shelf.  



\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption{Exemplary shelf and generic technical drawing.}%
	\label{fig:shelf}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Rotating Table}\label{sec:Rotating Table}
A Rotating Table is considered as a Service Area. The integration of Rotating Tables into tests is according the table \ref{tab:Instances}.  A Rotating Table as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:rottable} is used for these tests. The Objects placement is the same like in section \ref{ssec:ManipulationZone}, so the maximal depth for Objects is $20 \si{\centi\meter}$ and there is gap of $2\si{\centi\meter}$ to the border of the Rotating Table.


The height of the Rotating Table should be not lesser than $8\si{\centi\meter}$ and not be more than $12\si{\centi\meter}$. The diameter of the Rotating Table should be not lesser than $50\si{\centi\meter}$ and not more than $100\si{\centi\meter}$. The Rotating Table has to have a white surface colour. The rotating speed depends on the diameter. The Objects speed should be able to vary between $5 \si{\centi\meter\per\second} \le v_{object} \le 20 \si{\centi\meter\per\second}$ and has to be adjusted by the referees before a team starts its run to a fixed value. This is changed after each run to another random chosen value in this range. During the run of a team the speed is static. Example: For a Rotating Table with diameter $d_{table}=1\si{\meter}$, Objects are placed on a grasp region with the diameter $d_{object}=0.8\si{\meter}$ with $\omega_{table} = \frac{2 \cdot v_{objects} }{d_{grasp}}=\frac{2 \cdot 0.2}{0.8}=0.5\si{\radian\per\second}$ and with $n_{table}=\frac{\omega_{table}}{2 \cdot \pi}=\frac{0.5}{2 \cdot \pi}$ the minimum rotational speed of the Rotating Table $n_{table}= 0.0796 \si{\per\second}$ (rounds per second) can be calculated.

\section{Service Areas}
\label{sec:Service_Areas}

\subsection{General} 
\label{subsec:Service_Areas_General}

A Service Area indicates a location for a robot where tasks (e.g. picking or placing Objects) have to be performed.
Such a location is usually a Table with a flat white top (see fig. \ref{fig:arena_example}), but can also be a Rotating Table, Shelf, precise placement station or any other type needed for a specific task.
In order to successfully reach a Service Area, robots must position themselves in front of the Service Area in a way that allows manipulation of the Objects of interest and the robot has to stand still. To enable robots to reach such a position, a rectangular area with $80\si{\centi\meter}$ width must be kept free of Obstacles (see fig. \ref{fig:arena_service_area_free}). 

\begin{figure} [h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width= 0.8\textwidth ]{./images/general_rules/arena_service_area_free_space}
	\caption{Free Space in front of a Service Area}
	\label{fig:arena_service_area_free}
\end{figure}

The arena layout must define where the "front" of a table is.
Figure \ref{fig:arena_map_annotated} gives an example for the definition of the position of each Service Area, marking them as WSx (Workstation x), SHx (Shelf x) and RTx (Rotating Table x). The orientation only indicates the direction of the Service Area. It does not specify the robot's heading, which may be chosen by teams according to their individual robot design.

Tables that can be used from both sides (see fig. \ref{fig:arena_example}) are sometimes defined as two seperate workstations (e.g. WS5 \& WS6). However, manipulation of theses Service Area requires the robot to have its center in the rectangular area defined in fig. XX TODO. This means that manipulation of the opposite Service Area is NOT allowed (see \ref{ssec:ManipulationZone}), even though it would be physically possible.

This rule also applies to the two positions for the Rotating table (RT1 and RT2).
This makes smaller physical layouts possible that still provide the ability to create complex navigation challenges due to the amount of locations to visit.


\subsection{Arbitrary Surfaces and Decoys}
\label{subsec:Arbitrary_Surfaces_and_Decoys}

In order to make the operating environment more realistic, the Service Areas can contain different kinds of Arbitrary Surfaces (Figure \ref{fig:ast_surface_example}) with industrial items as Decoys (Figure \ref{fig:ast_example}). The Arbitrary Surfaces don't have to be fixed mounted at the Service Areas. Examples of Arbitrary Surfaces can be different wood pattern, grass, alufoil, plexiglas etc. The integration of Arbitrary Surfaces and Decoys into tests is according the table \ref{tab:Instances}.

\subsection{Containers}
As in many industrial settings, the \RCAW environment may be equipped with several Containers (see Figure~\ref{fig:containers}). The Containers are defined as industrial plastic stacking boxes size 2B, outer dimensions: $135 \times 160 \times 82  \si{\milli\meter}$, usable dimensions: $120 \times 125 \times 65  \si{\milli\meter}$  in red ca. RAL 3020 and blue ca. RAL 5015.
% \href{https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0062TUUOE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1}{example Container from amazon} (visited Januar 2022). 
They can store any kind of Object defined in Section~\ref{ssec:ManipulationObjects}. Robots are supposed either to grasp one or multiple Objects out of Containers or to place previously grasped Objects into them. Several Containers can be present in the environment and are always associated with a Service Area. That means that the Container itself will be placed within the manipulation zone defined in Section~\ref{ssec:ManipulationZone}.
It is also possible that more than one Container is placed at a single Service Area, but not multiple Containers of the same color.
The constraints defined in Section~\ref{ssec:ManipulationZone} apply also to the Containers.
Currently, a Container itself does not need to be manipulated or transported by the robot.

\begin{figure} [h!]

	\end{center}
	\caption{Containers can be used for grasping Objects out or placing Objects into them.}
	\label{fig:containers}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Manipulation Zone} \label{ssec:ManipulationZone}
The manipulation zone defines the area where Objects can be placed. Thereby, the following constraints need to be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The maximum depth of the manipulation zone is $20\si{\centi\meter}$.
	\item The minimum distance between Objects to each other is $20\si{\centi\meter}$.
	\item The minimum distance of the beginning of the manipulation zone to a Wall is $10\si{\centi\meter}$.
	\item There as an offset of $2\si{\centi\meter}$ from the border of the Service Area to the manipulation zone.
\end{itemize}
Note, the constraints do not permit, that Objects can be partially occluded dependent on the viewpoint.

For the placement of Objects the following terms are used:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Position: point within 2D coordinate system of a Manipulation Zone,
	\item Rotation: rotation around vertical axis of a Manipulation Zone,
	\item Orientation: rotation around horizontal axes of a Manipulation Zone, i.e. whether the Object is standing upright or lying on its side
	\item Pose: combination of position, rotation and orientation.

\section{Objects} \label{ssec:ManipulationObjects}
The Objects in \RCAW shall include a wide range of Objects relevant in industrial applications of robotics. They eventually cover any raw material, (semi-)finished parts or products as well as tools and possibly operating materials required for manufacturing processes.
\par

The intention is to start with a simple set of Objects of different shapes and colors. Every year, the spectrum shall then be widen in at least one aspect. 
The initial set of Objects includes basic standard screws and nuts with various sizes and masses as well as so called rocking Objects as shown in table~\ref{tab:manipulation_objects} and table~\ref{tab:manipulation_objects_rockin}. Objects of one kind can slightly vary e.g. considering the surface and coating colour. 
Rocking Objects are spare parts from the KUKA you-bot platform often used in the competition, due to the fact that the KUKA you-bot and the rocking Objects are not longer produced in future those Objects will be replaced with other standard parts used in industry as shown in Section~\ref{sec:new_objects}. 

\textbf{REMARK:} In 2022 teams has the option to use a set of original rocking Objects or a set of 3D printed rocking Objects. The set of 3D printed Objects has to be printed in standard grey/silver colour using fine quality settings and PLA as printing material. An example is given with PLA Silver ( ca. RAL 9006), thickness 1.75 or 2.85, not specified in detail.
