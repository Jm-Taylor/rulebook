\section{Participation in the Competition}\label{sec:participation_in_the_competition}
Participation in \RCAW requires successfully passing a qualification procedure. This procedure is to ensure the quality of the competition event and the safety of participants. Depending on constraints imposed by a particular site or the number of teams interested to participate, it may not be possible to admit all interested teams to the competition.
 
\subsection{Steps to Participate}
All teams that intend to participate at the competition have to perform the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Preregistration (may be optional; currently by sending email to the TC)
	\item Submission of qualification material, including a team description 				paper and possibly additional material like videos or drawings
	\item Final registration (qualified teams only)
\end{enumerate}


All dates and concrete procedures will be communicated in due time in advance.

\subsection{Qualification}
The qualification process serves a dual purpose: It should allow the TC to assess the safety of the robots a team intents to bring to a competition, and it should allow to rank teams according to a set of evaluation criteria in order to select the most promising teams for a competition, if not all interested teams can be permitted. The TC will select the qualified teams according to the qualification material provided by the teams. The evaluation criteria will include:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Team description paper
	\item Relevant scientific contribution/publications
	\item Professional quality of robot and software
	\item Novelty of approach
	\item Relevance to industry
	\item Performance in previous competitions
	\item Contribution to \RCAW league, e.g. by
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Organization of events
			\item Provision and sharing of knowledge
		\end{itemize}
	\item Team web site

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Team Description Paper}
The \iaterm{Team Description Paper}{TDP} is a central element of the qualification process and has to be provided by each team as part of the qualification process. All TDPs will be included in the CD  proceedings of the \RC Symposium. The TDP should at least contain the following information in the author/title section of the paper:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Name of the team (title)
	\item Team members (authors), including the team leader
	\item Link to the team web site
	\item Contact information
\end{itemize}


The body of the TDP should contain information on the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item focus of research/research interest
	\item description of the hardware, including an image of the robot(s)
	\item description of the software, esp. the functional and software architectures
	\item innovative technology (if any)
	\item reusability of the system or parts thereof
	\item applicability and relevance to industrial tasks
\end{itemize}


The team description paper should cover in detail the technical and scientific approach, while the team web site should be designed for a broader audience. Both the web site and the TDP have to be written in English.
