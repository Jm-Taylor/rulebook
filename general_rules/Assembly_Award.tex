\section{Introduction and Motivation}
In order to increase the complexity an assembly challenge will be hold. During this challenge a series of tests will be performed. The tests will focus on scaled down assembly tasks. The tests will be included into the main challenge in the next years and new tests may be introduced.

\input{./tests/BWT.tex}

\input{./tests/AWT.tex}

\input{./tests/BAT.tex}


\section{Instances}
In 2016 a the following tests will be used to determine the best approach to assembly.

- BWT

- AWT

- BAT
