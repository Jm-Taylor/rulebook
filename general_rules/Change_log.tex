\chapter{Summary of Changes}

This chapter provides an overview for experienced teams that know the rules and just need an update on what is new for the specific year. All new teams are strongly advised to read the whole rule book thoroughly.

\section{General Changes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The preparation time was lowered to just one minute. In turn, the run-times of the more complex tests were increased.
  \item Arbitrary surfaces to pick from may now be encountered in any test.
  \item While the Basic Navigation Test is still defined in the rulebook, its use is discouraged, as every test allows to gain points for just navigating. The test may be removed completely in the future.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each team is required to provide a member posing as an interview partner who can answer questions about the robot during the run.
  \item A promotional video of the robot performing {\RCAW} tasks is now required along with the TDP.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rewards}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Modified the rewards to better reflect the difficulty of the challenges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Arbitrary Surface Test (AST) was incorporated to the main test line.
  \item The Human-Robot Collaboration test evaluates the recognition skills of the robot.
  \item The Cluttered Pick test evaluates the segmentation, planning, and picking capabilities of the robot.
\end{itemize}
