\subsection{League Committees}
The following list of committees is implemented for RoboCup@Work.

\subsubsection{Executive Committee}

\par
Currently, the Industrial Advisory Board has no members yet.

\subsubsection{ Research Advisory Board}
The role of the Research Advisory Board is to ensure that the tests and scenarios are innovative and relevant from a research point of view. The members will be recruited from academic institutions and research organizations.
\par
Currently, the Research Advisory Board has no members yet.

\subsection{League Infrastructure}
In order to provide a forum for continuous discussions between teams and other stakeholders, the league builds and maintains an infrastructure consisting of web site, mailing lists, and repositories for documentation, software, and data. The infrastructure is complemented by a minimum infrastructure to be built and maintained by teams, i.e. teams should eventually create their own web page to which the RoboCup@Work League’s web pages can be linked.

\subsubsection{Infrastructure Maintained by the League}
The official website of RoboCup@Work is at

http://www.robocupatwork.org

This web site is the central place for information about the league. It contains general introductory information plus links to all other infrastructure components, such as a league wiki, the mailing lists, important documents such as this rule book, announcements of upcoming events as well as past events and participating teams.
\par
The league maintains several mailings lists:
\par
rc-work@lists.robocup.org
\par
This is the general RoboCup@Work mailing list. Anyone can subscribe, but a real name must be provided either as part of the email address or being specified on the mailing list subscription page. The list is moderated in order to avoid abuse by spammers. 
\par
rc-work-tc@lists.robocup.org
\par
This is the mailing list for the Technical Committee. Posts from non-members have to be approved by the list moderator. Approvals will be given only in well-justified cases.

\subsubsection{Infrastructure Maintained by Teams}
Each team is requested to build and maintain a minimum infrastructure for the team. This infrastructure consist of 

\begin{itemize}
	\item a team web site,
	\item a team contact, and
	\item a team mailing address.
\end{itemize}

The team web site should contain the following information:

\begin{itemize}
	\item name of the team, and team logo, if any
	\item affiliation of the team
	\item team leader including full contact information
	\item list of team members
	\item description of the team’s research interest and background
	\item description of specific approach pursued by the team
	\item description of the robot(s) used by the team
	\item list of relevant publications by team members

\end{itemize}

The team contact should be the official contact of the team. Usually, for university-based teams, this would be an academic person such as a professor or post-doc, who should, however, be responsive and be able to answer quickly when contacted by email.
\par
The team mailing address should be an email alias, which should be used to subscribe the team to the general RoboCup@Work mailing list. The email alias should at least include the team contact and the team leader.
