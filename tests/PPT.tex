\section{Precision Placement Test}
\label{sec:Precision Placement Test}

\paragraph{Purpose and Focus of the Test}
The purpose of the \iaterm{Precision Placement Test}{PPT} is to assess the robot's ability to grasp and place objects into object-specific cavities. This demands advanced perception abilities (to recognize the correct cavity for each object) and manipulation abilities (to grasp and place the object in such a manner that it fits into the cavity).

\paragraph{Scenario Environment}
The same arena as for the Basic Manipulation Test is used. In case that the arena does not already include a modified service area as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ppt_plattform}, it will be added only for this particular test. The modified service arena includes object-specific cavities as shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:ppt_tiles}. For each object used in the test, there will be one specific cavity. The cavity has the dimension of the object plus a 2 mm offset for each dimension. At most five cavities are used in the test.

\paragraph{Manipulation Objects}
The manipulation objects used in this test are defined by the instances described in Table~\ref{tab:Instances}.

\paragraph{Task}
The objective of the task is to pick the objects which are placed on one service area and make a precise placement in the corresponding cavity at the service area with the special PPT platform (an example configuration is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ppt_plattform}).

\end{figure}

The task consists of multiple grasp and place operations, possibly with base movement in between, which will, however, be short. Note that the placement of the object in the cavity is finished when the object is fallen into the cavity (i.e. at least some part of the object has to touch ground floor underneath the cavity).

%
%\subsection{Complexity Levels}
%
%All Complexity Options from BMT apply.
%
%\subsubsection{PPT Orientation Complexity (bonus factor = 0.2):}
%The cavities can be placed in all orientations.
%\subsubsection{PPT Rotation Complexity (bonus factor = 0.2):}
%The cavities can be placed in all orientations.

\paragraph{Rules}
The following rules have to be obeyed:

\begin{itemize}

\item A single robot is used.
\item The robot has to start from outside the arena and to end in the final.
\item The order in which the teams have to perform will be determined by a draw.
\item The robot will get the task specification from the referee box.
\item A service area counts as successfully reached as defined in Section~\ref{ssec:Navigating}.
%\item A manipulation object counts as successfully grasped as specified in Section~\ref{ssec:GraspingObjects}.
\item An object counts as placed correctly if it fell through the correct cavity and touches the ground beneath. It may happen that an object blocks the cavity for the next object, e.g. by standing upright on the floor. In that case a referee may remove that object (which remains to count as a successful place). If the referee is not able to do so and the robot places another object into the blocked cavity, it counts as a correct placement if it would have been successful without the blocking object.
\item The run is over when the robot reached the final position or the designated time has expired.
\item The score for this test will be calculated as defined in \ref{sec:ScoringAndRanking}.

\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Scoring}
%Points are awarded as follows:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 50 points are awarded for successfully grasping an object.
%\item 100 points are awarded for successfully placing a manipulation object into the correct cavity.
%\item 50 points are awarded if the task specification has been completely fulfilled. The task is considered as fulfilled if all objects have been dropped in the right cavity. The robot does not have to leave the arena.
%\item a penalty of -50 points is given for each object which has been dropped into the wrong cavity
%\item The reached points of a test will be multiplied with a defined complexity factor depending on the previously chosen complexity level.
%\end{itemize}
