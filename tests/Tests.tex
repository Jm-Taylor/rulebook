The actual competition contains a set of so-called tests. 
A test is specified in terms of it's purpose and focus, environment features and eventually manipulation objects involved. Further, a concrete specification of the task is given and the rules to be obeyed. 

Each test has different variability dimensions. That is, which objects to be manipulated, how many locations to visit, from which height to grasp etc. These dimensions are described in Section~\ref{sec:TestVariability} whereas in Section~\ref{sec:ScoringAndRanking} test instances for \YEAR are defined based on the general test description and instantiation of the variability dimensions.

%The different optional parameters and configurations for each task are 
%mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:ArenaDesign} and \ref{sec:ManipulationTasks}. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:complexityTree} summarizes the possible variations and 
%emphasizes aspects that may be chosen.
