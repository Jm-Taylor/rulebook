\subsection{Common Rules}
\label{ssec: Common Rules}


Unless stated other, the following rules apply to all test types:

\begin{itemize}
\item The order in which the teams have to perform will be determined by a draw from the OC.
\item Teams must not hardcode information gained from runs of previous teams.
\item A single robot is used.
\item The robot must not leave the arena.
\item The maximum objects a robot is allowed to carry is 3.
\item The robot has to start and end at the respective arena location (START, FINISH).
\item The robot will get the task specification from the referee box.
\item Reaching succesfully a Service Area is rewarded as defined in \ref{tab:InstancePoints}.
\item The reward for reaching a Service Area will be only rewared once for a Service Area.
\item Service Areas count as succesfully reached as defined in section \ref{sec:ArenaDesign}.
\item Manipulation tasks count as successful as defined in \ref{ssec:GraspingObjects} and \ref{ssec:PlacingObjects}.
\item The score for this test will be calculated as defined in \ref{sec:ScoringAndRanking}.
\item Exact test specification is displayed in table \ref{tab:Instances}.
\end{itemize}

%The actual competition contains of a set of so-called tests. 
%A test is specified in terms of it's purpose and focus, environment features and eventually manipulation objects involved. Further, a concrete specification of the task is given and the rules to be obeyed. 

%Each test has different variability dimensions. That is, which objects to be manipulated, how many locations to visit, from which height to grasp etc. The test instances for \YEAR are defined based on the general test description and can be seen in Section~\ref{sec:ScoringAndRanking}.




%Every test has some navigation to a service area involved in it. Successful navigation will be awarded in every test according to Table \ref{tab:InstancePoints}. A navigation to a service area is successful when the robot reached the service area as defined in section \ref{ssec:Navigating}. The rewarded points for navigation to a servie area will be only awarded once per service area.

\subsection{Grasping Objects} \label{ssec:GraspingObjects}

An Object counts as successfully grasped, if the robot grasps the correct Object of the correct Service Area and transport it to his platform. 

If the Objects falls down from the platform, the robot drops the Object to the floor or on top of the Manipulation Zone from a height higher than $5\si{\centi\meter}$ while the grasping rocess it is counted as an incorrect Object grasping. A robot is allowed to grasps an incorrect Object as long as the Object don't leave the Service Area with his complete form. This enables a robot to grasp an Object to examine the Object with a camera. If an incorrect Object grasped and moved out of the Manipulation Zone it is counted as an incorrect Object grasping.


\subsection{Placing Objects} \label{ssec:PlacingObjects}

An Object counts as successfully placed, if the robot places an correct Object to a Manipulation Zone of the correct Service Area. The pose of the Object on the Manipulation Zone can be chosen freely by the robot. The robot has to place the Object so that the Object is lying with his complete form inside the Manipulation Zone. 

It is not allowed that a placed Object touches another Objects or Containers while the placing process at the Manipulation Zone and the placed Object has to standing still at the end of the run. It is not allowed to place the Object from a height higher than $5\si{\centi\meter}$ to the top of the Manipulation Zon. If one of these situations happens it is counted as an incorrect Object placing.

\lucas{What if the object is placed/falls down with a height higher than 5cm? 0 points or even penalty}
\lucas{placing otuside the Manipulation zone halfs the total rewarded points for suc placing}
\lucas{touching another Objects/container halfs the total rewarded points for suc placing}
\leander{"while the placing process" not clear... also after placing, it is not allowed}
