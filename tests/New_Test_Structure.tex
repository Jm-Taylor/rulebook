\section{New Test Structure}
\label{sec:New Test Structure}

For the 2023 season and onwards, the TC decided to restructure the benchmark tests.
The main changes include:

\begin{itemize}
\item The dedicated test slots for "Precise Placement" and "Rotating Table" were removed. 
PP and RT were included in the more advanced tests.
\item As this removes two competition slots from the schedule and therefore leaves some "free time", one additional transportation task was added.
\item The now four total transportation tasks were split into two categories: "basic" and "advanced".
\item The requirements for all "basic" tasks (BMT, BTT1 \& BTT2) were relaxed in order for them to suit the naming.
\end{itemize}

We think that this had the following effects:

\begin{itemize}
\item The complexity of each test now increases more linear over the competition.
\item Teams with less experience should be able to successfully participate in the competition for longer rather than coming out of a test with no points.
\item Perfect runs are more achievable (for experienced teams) in the beginner tasks,
 bringing back more relevance to bonus points for reliable and consistent performance.
\end{itemize}
