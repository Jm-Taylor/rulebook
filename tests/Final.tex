\section{Final}
\label{sec:Final}

The \iaterm{Final Run}{Final} acts as the full benchmark for robots, including all elements of \RCAW.
With the number of objects and active service areas at its peak, task planning and execution speed may become a limiting factor for competing robots. 

\paragraph{Final}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ten randomly selected objects have to be transported.
\item Seven randomly selected decoy objects are placed onto one or more randomly selected (active) service areas
\item There will be eight active service areas (four tables,  two shelfs, one Rotating Table and one Precise Placement table)
\item All table heights are used (0-15 $\si{\centi\meter}$).
\item Two objects must be picked from a shelf (lower part).
\item Two objects must be picked from the Rotating Table.
\item Two objects must be placed on a shelf (top part).
\item Two objects must be Precise Placed.
\item Four objects must be placed into a container (preferably two to each color).
\item Two visual and two physical obstacles are placed inside the arena (two blocking, one semi-blocking, one non-blocking).
\item Four service areas will have an arbitrary surface.
\end{itemize}
