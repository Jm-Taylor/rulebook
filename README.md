Rulebook for RoboCup@Work
========

This repository contains the current rulebook for the RoboCup@Work competitions.
The PDF 'Rulebook.pdf' is usually up-to-date, but you can always check out this repository and build it yourself,
especially if you want to keep track of newer inofficial releases.

## Release for 2023

We have released the Official Rulebook for the Season 2023!
Please note the changelog but also read the rest carefully!
Issue [#64](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/rulebook/issues/64) has caused quite major changes!


## Updates for the World Cup 2023

After the German Open in June 2023, we have noticed some minor shortcomings in phrasing 
and therefore added some clarifications regarding how a rule is meant and to be interpreted.

The original version is still in the main branch, but we strongly advise you to use the
update branch 'beyond_1.0' to always get the latest version of the rulebook.

This version is also what will be used during the World Cup in July 2023 in Bordeaux!
