Rulebook for RoboCup@Work
========

The rulebook is automatically build and stored as artifact. Please visit [Link](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/rulebook/actions) to download the latest version. 

You can also just use the PDF version inside of this Repo.
Currently the latest one is called 'RulebookFinal2022.pdf'.


## Alpha for 2023

The release of the official rulebook for the season of 2023 is planned for March 2023.
You can keep track of the most important changes in our GitHub Issues.

You can also switch to the "Alpha_2023" branch if you want to track our progress more detailed.
However, until we announce otherwise, the releases there are NOT official.

Please note especially [#64](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/rulebook/issues/64) as it is a quite major change!
