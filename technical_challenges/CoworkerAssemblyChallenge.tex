\section{Coworker Assembly Test}

In the \iaterm{Coworker Assembly Test}{COT}, 
the goal is for a robot to produce a product while cooperating with a human worker.

Therefore, the robot has to collect three components scattered in the arena and bring them to a single workstation where the human worker waits on the other side of the table.
The robot has to place the objects and then wait for the human to assemble the objects to a product.
Once the human worker (a teammember of the performing team) has assembled the product, he/she must place the product back onto the table and give the robot a completion signal. This may be done via sign (visual) or voice (acoustic). It is not allowed to use controller or keyboard input.

Once the robot has recognized the signal, 
it must detect the assembled product, grasp it and then deliver it to another workstation.
This step concludes the assembly process by imitating the transport of the product to a warehouse.

Three object sets can be assembled during the COT: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set 1: Screw M20\_100 and Spacer and Nut M20
	\item Set 2: Bearing2 and  Housing
	\item Set 3: Axis2 and Nut M20  
\end{itemize}
