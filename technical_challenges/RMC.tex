\section{RoboCup Manipulation Challenge}

This challenge is not part of the @work technical challenges. It's a RoboCup challenge sponsored and supported by MathWorks, Franka-Emika and P\&G. Because it is about manipulation, all @work teams are invited to participate. The challenge took place the first time in 2021 as a simulation competition. In 2022 it will be simulation again, but in 2023 it should become real. The idea is to provide a real industrial use case via industrial partners. 

TODO: add ref to 2022 edition, brief description, price money
