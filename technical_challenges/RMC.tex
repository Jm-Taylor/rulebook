\section{RoboCup Manipulation Challenge}

This challenge is not part of the normal @work technical challenges, but because it's about manipulation, all @Work-Teams are invited to participate. It's a joint challenge between RoboCup@Home and RoboCup@Work on
Autonomous Robot Manipulation (ARM), supported by MathWorks. More details can be found  at \url{arm.robocup.org}.

All teams which are already registered for @Work (or @Home) can participate (or register for the challenge only). All participants will receive a certificate of participation and all teams which delivers a working solution with non-zero performance will receive a \grqq proficiency\grqq \ certificate on robot manipulation and MathWorks tools issued by RoboCup Federation and MathWorks. The winner will receive an award of up to \$5,000 in the form of a grant for research acitivities. This challenge will continue and envolve in the next years.
