\section{Master Communication Test}

The purpose of the \iaterm{Master Communication Test}{MCT} is to introduce the atwork-commander to all (espeically new) teams and encourage them to implement reliable communications.
Therefore, a BTT1 test configuration is created but not sent as whole, but rather as individual transportation tasks.
Robots must confirm a successfully completet task before receiving the next one, meaning they can only perform one task if they do not have logging / feedback implemented.
