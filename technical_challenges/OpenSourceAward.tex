% \section{Open Source Award}

The \iaterm{Open Source Award}{OSA} can be given to a team that contributes part of its hardware architecture or software.
The open source solution to a specific problem can be used by other teams (especially new ones) as a starting point for their own development.
This contributes to the ongoing development and research of the league.

Teams can apply for the award on-site at a RoboCup@Work competition.
Links to the open source resources, including sufficient documentation, must be provided.
All participating teams review and rate the material internally and communicate their decision to the TC via the team leader.
The TC is not involved in the evaluation process.

Voting criteria may include
\begin{itemize}
	\item Usefulness
	\item Well documented
	\item Complexity
	\item Easily adaptable by other teams
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Voting System}: Each participating team will receive a score from 0-5. 
0 points would mean that no meaningful material is provided. 
5 points would mean that the submitted material fully meets the team's voting criteria.
The TC adds up the votes. The team with the most points wins the OSA \textbf{if the number of points divided by the number of voting teams is at least 3}.
