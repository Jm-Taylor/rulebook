\section{Real Object Test}

The purpose of the \iaterm{Real Object Test}{ROT} is to introduce a new set of objects to the league that aims to replace the hard-to-get RoCKin objects.

Therefore, a BTT2 test configuration is created that only includes the new objects defined in section \ref{sec:new_objects}. Teams should be able to participate if they are able to detect and grasp the new objects.
