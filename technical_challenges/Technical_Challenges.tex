In order to value very specific capabilities required in {\RCAW}, technical challenges are part of \RCAW.
These challenges are designed to be included into the major competition after they have shown a potential as a benchmark in industrial robotics, and have been solved in principle by at least one team.
Each technical challenge is separately awarded. That means, teams can participate in any number of them.
